            The project is already set up with all dependencies installed.
            The server is already running at localhost:3000. Logs from it
            are being written to logs.txt. If needed, you can query the
            db with the 'sqlite3' cli. If needed, use the mcp_playwright
            set of tools to launch a browser and interact with the app.
